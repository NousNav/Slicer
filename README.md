What is this project ?
----------------------

This project is **NOT** the official Slicer repository.

It is a fork of Slicer sources hosted at https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer

It is used as staging area to maintain topics specific to NousNav that will eventually be contributed back to the official repository.


What is the branch naming convention ?
--------------------------------------

Each branch is named following the pattern `nousnav-vY.Y.Z-YYYY-MM-DD-SHA{N}`

where:

* `vX.Y.Z` is the version of Slicer
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the last official commit associated with the branch.
* `SHA{N}` are the first N characters of the last official commit associated with the branch.
